**DISCLAIMER:**	  
**This game does not represent any one coding bootcamp, it is just my interpretation.	
And spoiler alert, but the goal of this game is to graduate and get a job. Completing the basic obstacles in this game does not resemble how to get a job in the real world** 






## Description




## Statement of Purpose	

The goal was develop a game that resembles someone learning to code. The game will provide challenges, fun, laughs, but most importantly, reiterate the values of a Growth Mindset when learning. The game is inspired from, more-or-less, every episode of the TV show Scrubs. This show provided challenges to the main character and laughs along the way, but majority of episodes, there was always something the main character learnt, a life lesson for example, which is what I hoped to encapsulate. The life lesson I approached was to motivate the user into seeing the value of helping others. Not only do they get experience if they do, but gets to help another along the way.

The audience for the game is tailored towards a programmer. As the type of questions that are presented to the user throughout the game are coding based, so for a non-programmer, these would be quite difficult, still possible, but a lot more time consuming. This game is also specifically tailored towards a programmer who is in the learning stages. We are all always learning, but a new programmer is someone who faces these types of challenges every day, and these users will receive the most enjoyment for the game.

I had never developed a game myself which is why I chose to undertake my first one as a text adventure, which seemed appropriate for a terminal app as well. Putting enjoyment at the front of design (apart from UI) was a challenge I enjoyed.

## Features	

### Current features:
**spoiler alert**
- player will face challenges involving 3 questions
- player will get different amounts of EXP depending on how they complete the challenges
- at multiple points throughout the game the player is offered opportunities to give up
- player can level up with extra activities
- once player reaches desired EXP, they graduate and look for a job (complete the game)
- if they are not at the desired EXP, they are required to undertake extra activities before completion to level up

### Possible features:

- the player can choose if they want to do more extra activities at the end of the game
- add functionality to extra activities and so forth, rather than just a wait func
- add more than 3 questions in to challenges
- store a list of questions in a file in docs, which a script will then put those questions and answers into the app
- display more ascii characters around, regarding a levels, extra activities and enemies
- add question and stage number counter under message
- player can receive a generated graduate certificate to download at the end of the game
- add assignments as another challenge for the player
- have EXP levels for each sub class of extra activities that contribute and also have different modifiers that calculate towards total EXP
- have the ability for a player to start out at different levels (master, advanced, beginner and noob programmers), for initial release, everyone starts out at noob
- have different levels of questions i.e. they will get harder as the game progresses, and also if the player chooses to start out at a higher level they will receive harder questions form the start


## Code Structure

### Gems used:
- tty-prompt

## Installation Instructions
1. Follow these instructions to [download and install](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) Ruby on your computer. 

```
> install bundler
```
4. Ask bundle to install the gems that we use for the program.
