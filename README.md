## Description




## Statement of Purpose	

The goal is to develop an application that resembles someone learning to code in a Coding Bootcamp. A re-imagining of the experiences that programmers will face in a learning environment to some small degree (respective of time frame of development). The game must provide some challenges, fun, laughs, but most importantly, reiterate the values of Growth Mindset. The game is inspired from more-or-less every episode of the Scrubs TV show. This show provided challenges and laughs, but majority of the time in each episode, there was always something the main character learnt from the challenges he faced throughout the episode. To bottle this concept up is challenging, but one that must be taken. Some games don't necessarily solve a problem, apart from the main concept of providing enjoyment to their player base. However, on top of this, the goal of this game is to motivate the user into seeing the value in helping others. Not only do they get experience, but the help the other person along the way. In the time frame provided, to resemble this concept throughout the journey is a must, at least scratching the surface of it. Finally, to finish the game, the player is Graduating/	

The reason for this game's creation has been explained above, but to add on the reasoning for myself, is that personally I have never developed a game. Games main goal is to provide enjoyment, so for that to be at the front of design (outside of UI) is a challenge for myself. Putting all the learnt experiences together as a whole will be the challenge for myself. Especially Classes as this topic was new to me. 	## Motivation

Audience for the game is mainly tailored towards a programmer. As the type of questions that are presented to the user throughout the game are coding based, so for a non-programmer, these would be possible, but a lot more time consuming. This game is also specifically tailored towards a programming who is learning to code. We are all always learning, but a new programmer is someone who faces these types of challenges every day, and these users will receive the most enjoyment for the game.
