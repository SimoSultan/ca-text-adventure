### Major Milestone near Halfway
When scrolling through the 'tty-prompt' Gem, I can't remember what I was looking at, but I managed to come up with the idea of how to make the much more interactive and fun to play. Initially the challenges were going to consist of a lot of wait (sleep) methods, which would resemble people learning and stumbling. However, the idea I came up with was to incorporate real coding questions into the challenges. The MCQ Kahoot questions in the bootcamp I attend heavily inspired the style.
This would change a large chunk of my plan for Challenges, but it was worth undertaking as the game would be much more enjoyable. I still used the fundamentals of the original Challenges Flow Chart, but would alter it them, in turn making the flow more condensed as well. As can be seen in the 2 images provided.

Original Challenges:

----

- 22/04/20 `12:00` - **Incorporating this idea back into the flow chart - using 3 placeholder questions for all 9 questions**
- 22/04/20 `14:00` - **Challenges are working as intended**
- 22/04/20 `16:00` - **Have all Challenges and Extra Activities flowing as intended**
- 22/04/20 `16:30` - **Developed method where player does not have enough EXP at end of Challenges**
- 22/04/20 `16:45` - **Added in code to other sub classes now (Medium/Youtube etc) - these are similar to Twitter, except text/strings**
- 22/04/20 `16:45` - **Added in code to other sub classes now (Medium/Youtube etc) - these are similar to Twitter, except text/strings**
- 22/04/20 `17:00` - **First successful play through**


> Thursday 23rd April 2020

- 23/04/20 `16:30` - **Added in 6 more questions to make all unique**
- 23/04/20 `17:30` - **Decided to drop initial choice of player's level (Master/Advanced etc) due to it not sitting well with the MVP. Was too easy for the player to receive easy EXP. However this will be added back in later when there is functionality around the whole idea**
- 23/04/20 `18:00` - **Refactored player class by making all player methods present in its class**
- 23/04/20 `18:00` - **Also discovering the need to have the Game instance Global. I could pass in the object each time, but the Game instance should be accessed by everything so Global seemed appropriate and less error prone**
- 23/04/20 `18:30` - **Altered all Game objects to Global**
- 23/04/20 `22:00` - **Started styling the game with coloured text, logos and loading symbols (sourced from tty-spinner)**

> Friday 24th April 2020

- 24/04/20 `03:00` - **Finished styling the game**
- 24/04/20 `13:00` - **Tidied up code and comments everywhere needed**
- 24/04/20 `14:00` - **Developed method for player to help out another player after challenges**
- 24/04/20 `15:00` - **Player helping method working**
- 24/04/20 `15:30` - **Testing game to ensure 'feel' is correct**
- 24/04/20 `16:30` - **Developed method where player has an enemy 'Comparison' take some of their EXP, but give option for player to earn it back**
- 24/04/20 `17:30` - **Completion of MVP - additional nice to have features go in on Monday 27th**
